		<h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p> 
LanguageDCAT-AP is conceived and implemented as an extension of DCAT-AP, an application profile for data catalogues of European data portals. Thus, it builds upon DCAT-AP and DCAT for generic classes and properties, combined with domain-specific vocabularies already used in the broader language data and services community, and more specifically, the META-SHARE ontology . For the set of attributes to be used, their data types and mandatoriness, we rely on expertise from previous similar initiatives (e.g., ELG, CLARIN, ELRA , ELRC-SHARE, etc.), while taking a more holistic view of the information, as organised in the IDSA Information model  around six “concerns” (see Figure 3). The current version (Figure 4) includes a core set of attributes that help consumers discover data products and services, while the full set of attributes will be developed in future versions.

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>As detailed in the LDS Blueprint (D6.2 – Section 4.3.1), LDS proposes a common information model in line with recommendations of the DSSC blueprint, the Dataspace Protocol and relevant documents of other data space initiatives. In its final version, the model will cater for the description of the various LDS entities, i.e., the LDS participants, technical components, and more importantly, data and services. For the LDS preliminary version, we have focused on data assets, i.e., corpora, lexical/conceptual resources, and language models, suggesting for them the use of the LanguageDCAT-AP vocabulary. </p>
